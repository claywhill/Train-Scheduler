# Train-Scheduler
https://claywhill.github.io/Train-Scheduler/

This app allows the user to create a live train schedule that updates with the current time.
When the user submits the form, the data is saved to a database and then displayed in the table. 

The app includes the use of Firebase to store that data and Moment.js for the time.

To use the app, fill out the form below the Train Schedule table and click submit to see the newly created Train schedule.
